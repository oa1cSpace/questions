The setTimeout() returns a timeoutID which is a positive integer identifying the timer created as a result of calling the method.
The timeoutID can be used to cancel timeout by passing it to the clearTimeout() method.

setTimeout() function takes two parameters. First a function to be executed and second after how much time (in ms).
